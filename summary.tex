\noindent This report presents the work done in preparation for fusion of measurements from a lidar with measurements from a optical camera for collision avoidance purposes for an autonomous surface vehicle. A lidar has exellent capabilities with regards to range information, while the rich information from optical cameras make them well suited for object recognition. The detection of boats in images are generated by a Convolutional Neural Network, based on the framework of Faster R-CNN using a pre-trained model. Detections in images are compared with detections in the lidar point cloud. \\\vspace{1mm}\\
First, some background on sensor fusion and neural networks for visual detection is given. In order to perform sensor fusion, a relationship between the world coordinate system and the sensor frame of reference is necessary. Measurement models for both sensors are presented in chapter 3.\\\vspace{1mm}\\
In order to compare detections between the sensors, several experiments were performed in the channel near Ravnkloa in Trondheim. The gathered data was post processed and analyzed, and the results show that the lidar has good close-range detection capabilities in a maritime environment, with no obvious false detections once returns known to originate from the surroundings was removed. The image detections given by the Faster R-CNN network correlates well with lidar detections at close range, while at longer ranges the detections become influenced by boats and other objects in the background, leading to fewer detections ot the target.
