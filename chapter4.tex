\section{Sensors, Hardware and Processing Pipeline}
The physical sensor setup used in the data collection is illustrated in figure \ref{fig:sensor_setup}. A HP zbook 15 running Ubuntu 16.04 with ROS was used as a data collection platform.

The camera used to gather image data is a commercial off-the-shelf action camera by Muvi, named Veho K2 Sport. The reasoning for using such a camera was the affordable price, relatively high resolution, and a wide angle of view. The specifications of the camera is presented in table \ref{tab:specs_camera}. The specifications are pulled from the cameras user manual.

The settings used throughout the project is resolution at 1080p, with a framerate of 25 frames per second, with a wide angle of view (140$\degree$). A drawback with such a camera for computer vision applications, however, is the fact that it only sends images as a steady stream over its HDMI interface, with little options for the user to control the capture of individual frames. Moreover, HDMI is not a standard input interface on most computers, so a HDMI-to-USB3 adapter was purchased in order to be able to input the video stream on the computer. The HDMI-to-USB3 adapter is a USB Capture HDMI Gen 2 by the manufacturer Magewell. Using the camera with this interface, there is a noticeable processing delay between the camera and the computer.\\

\section{Visual Detection based on Faster R-CNN}
The visual detection of boats in images used in this project is based on the framework of Faster R-CNN, developed by Ren et al. \cite{ren15fasterrcnn}. This framework was used due to the availability of pre-trained networks developed during a Master thesis project at NTNU \cite{tangstad}. A brief introduction to the framework of Faster R-CNN is given in this section, some background on how the implemented model was trained, and some details concerning the implementation of the network in MATLAB. For a detailed explanation of the full framework of Faster R-CNN the reader is referred to \cite{ren15fasterrcnn}.
\subsection{Faster R-CNN}
Faster R-CNN is a region-based CNN, employing \textit{Region Proposal Networks} (RPN) to form a single, unified network for object detection. Faster R-CNN is composed of two modules. The first module is a deep fully convolutional neural network which proposes regions, and the second module is the Fast R-CNN detector \cite{Girshick_2015_ICCV} that uses the proposed regions in classification. Figure \ref{fig:faster_r_cnn} illustrates the system of Faster R-CNN.
\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{fig/faster_r_cnn_layers.png}
	\caption{Faster R-CNN as a single unified network for object detection. The figure is adapted from \cite{ren15fasterrcnn}.}
	\label{fig:faster_r_cnn}
\end{figure}
The Region Proposal Network takes an image of any size as inputs, feeding it through convolutional layers to generate feature maps. The area of activation is then fed into the RPN, which outputs object proposals in the form of rectangular regions, each with a objectness score. The objectness score is a measure of membership to a set of object classes versus background. The rectangular regions are subsequently fed into the classification layers where the classification score is obtained. In their paper, Ren et al. investigated two models for the classification network, the 5 convolutional layer deep Zeiler and Fergus model \cite{Zeiler2014} dubbed ZF-net, and the 16 convolutional layer deep Simonyan and Zisserman model \cite{VGG16}, dubbed VGG-16. In this project, the VGG-16 model is used, as this network achieved the best results in the Master thesis work of Tangstad \cite{tangstad}.

\subsection{Implementation Aspects}
A complete MATLAB implementation of Faster R-CNN is available on Github. In order to run Faster R-CNN, there are some software requirements that need to be met. The steps are listed in the Github repository for the framework \cite{faster_rcnn_git}, and will be repeated here for convenience. The steps are setup-dependent, depending on whether or not the framework will be executing on a GPU or a CPU, and also on the version of GPU used. The Faster R-CNN implementation available at the Github repository uses Caffe \cite{jia2014caffe}, which is a deep-learning framework utilizing Nvidia CUDA for parallel computing, developed by Berkeley AI Research. Caffe is well documented online, with installation instructions, tutorials and more \cite{caffe}. 

In order to use Faster R-CNN, a Caffe MEX file is needed. A MEX file is a dynamically linked subroutine that the MATLAB interpreter loads and executes, enabling MATLAB to utilize Caffe routines. A pre-compiled Caffe version for Nvidia CUDA version 6.5 is available in the repository, but for newer Nvidia GPUs a newer version of CUDA will need to be compiled along with Caffe. If a new compiling of Caffe is necessary, all the steps needed are provided in the Faster R-CNN branch of Caffe on Github \cite{caffe_for_faster_rcnn}. If a GPU is utilized for parallel computing, a GPU with minimum 8 Gigabytes of memory is needed to run the VGG-16 version. In this project Caffe was recompiled with CUDA version 9.0, due to CUDA version 6.5 not supporting the newer Pascal architecture on the Nvidia GTX 1070 graphics card used. MATLAB is also needed to run the Faster R-CNN implementation. Once all requirements are met, the steps necessary before testing are
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Run \lstinline[basicstyle=\ttfamily]{faster_rcnn_build.m}
	\item Run \lstinline[basicstyle=\ttfamily]{startup.m}
\end{enumerate}
Once this is done, the user must provide a valid network (pre-trained networks are available on the Github repository), and the model is ready for use.
\section{ROS Implementation}
In order to capture, organize, timestamp and save the collected data, the open-source robotics framework of ROS was used. The main ROS client libraries are geared towards a UNIX/Linux platform, mainly due to the dependency on large collections of open-source software dependencies \todo{kilde}. Ubuntu Linux is a supported distribution, while others, such as Fedora Linux, Mac OS, and Windows, are designated as experimental and are supported by the community. Due to the simplicity of installation and "out-of-the-box" functionality of ROS on Ubuntu Linux, the most recent long-term supported version of ROS, ROS Kinetic, was installed on a laptop running Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, which was used as a platform for running the various sensor drivers and collecting the data.
\subsection{ROS Nodes and Data Flow}
An overview of the implemented sensor driver and data processing nodes is illustrated in figure \ref{fig:ros_nodes}.
\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=.8\linewidth]{fig/ros.png}
    \caption{ROS nodes and topic flow.}
    \label{fig:ros_nodes}
\end{figure}
The lidar nodes and the camera node are all based on open-source ROS packages freely available from the ROS community. The camera driver used is the \\\lstinline[basicstyle=\ttfamily]{libuvc_camera} driver. This node reads the image stream from the camera over the USB port, providing a ROS interface for cameras meeting the USB Video Class standard \cite{libuvc_camera}. This node publishes messages containing an image corresponding to a single frame of the video stream, with a time stamp corresponding to the arrival time of the image frame over USB. The source code is available at the ROS device drivers repository \cite{ros_drivers}.\\
\vspace{2mm}\\
\noindent The lidar nodes are in the \lstinline[basicstyle=\ttfamily]{velodyne_driver}-package from the ROS device drivers repository \cite{ros_drivers}. This package provides two nodes, the first is \lstinline[basicstyle=\ttfamily]{/velodyne_driver} for collecting all TCP packages sendt over ethernet from the lidar and publishing a message containing the raw data from a full 360-degree scan from the lidar. The second node, \lstinline[basicstyle=\ttfamily]{/velodyne_cloud}, transforms the raw data into a point cloud given in the sensor frame in XYZ-coordinates, using the transformation in equation \ref{eq:simple_lidar} in section \ref{section:lidar_model}. In addition to the coordinates of each point, the corresponding intensity of the reflected signal strength and the ring data is published \cite{velodyne_dr<iver}.\\ 
\vspace{2mm}\\
\noindent The point cloud is then published as a ROS message. In addition to the coordinates of each point, the corresponding intensity of the reflected signal strength and the ring data is also included in this message \cite{velodyne_driver}.\\
\begin{table}[H]
	\centering
	\begin{tabularx}{.8\linewidth}{l L}\toprule
		\textbf{Topic} & \textbf{Content} \\\midrule
		\lstinline[basicstyle=\ttfamily]{sensor\_msgs/PointCloud2} & Message containing point cloud data from the lidar \\\midrule
		\lstinline[basicstyle=\ttfamily]{velodyne\_msgs/VelodyneScan} & Message containing raw data from a 360$\deg$ lidar scan \\\midrule
		\lstinline[basicstyle=\ttfamily]{sensor\_msgs/CompressedImage} & Message containing a compressed image in .JPEG format\\\midrule
		\end{tabularx}
	\caption{ROS Topics used in data collection.}
	\label{tab:topics}
\end{table}
\subsection{Rosbag}
ROS provides a built-in set of tools for recording and playing back ROS topics, \lstinline[basicstyle=\ttfamily]{rosbag} \cite{rosbag}. This toolset stores the topics of interest, specified as parameters in the command-line, to a file of the ROS bag format, with extension .bag. This toolset provides a simple method for storing data from experiments, and the playback function provides the option to simulate sensor inputs to the system without actually reading sensors. A basic use case, where for example two topics named \lstinline[basicstyle=\ttfamily]{/velodyne_points} and \lstinline[basicstyle=\ttfamily]{/camera/image} are to be recorded, the proper command line input is 
\begin{lstlisting}[basicstyle=\ttfamily]
	$ rosbag record -o file /pointcloud /camera/image
\end{lstlisting}
where \lstinline[basicstyle=\ttfamily]{file} is the user-specified filename for the .bag file. ROS appends the filename with the system time automatically. Rosbag was used in recording all experimental data.
\subsection{MATLAB implementation}
MATLAB provides ROS interfaces via the Robotics System Toolbox, making it possible to use ROS topics directly in MATLAB. The standard ROS message types are readily available, and custom ROS messages can easily be compiled provided the user supplies the messages in a folder following the ROS convention, with a \lstinline[basicstyle=\ttfamily]{package.xml} file listing all dependencies for the custom messages. The proper folder structure is shown in figure \ref{fig:ros_msg_folders}. For details on writing custom ROS messages and a corresponding \lstinline[basicstyle=\ttfamily]{package.xml} file, the reader is referred to the ROS documentation, available online \cite{ros_msgs}.
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=.5\linewidth]{fig/custom_message.png}
	\caption{ROS custom message folder structure.}
	\label{fig:ros_msg_folders}
\end{figure}
Building the custom messages can now be done by calling \lstinline[basicstyle=\ttfamily]{rosgenmsg} in the MATLAB terminal with the path to the custom message files as a input parameter. The MATLAB command window gives prompts on how to add the custom files to the Java class path and the MATLAB path, which must be done in order to use the custom messages.
\section{Camera Calibration}
\label{section:matlab_calibration}
As explained in section \ref{section:intrinsic_params}, one needs the cameras intrinsic parameters in order to associate pixel coordinates with world coordinates. MATLABs Computer Vision System Toolbox includes the Camera Calibrator application \cite{camera_calibrator}, which was used in calibrating the camera. The Camera Calibrator application implements the calibration routine by Zhang \cite{flexCal}, described in appendix \ref{app:cam_calibration}. The steps taken for calibrating the camera using this application can be summarized as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Prepare a checkerboard calibration pattern with known dimensions.
	\item Capture 20-40 images of the checkerboard with the camera, from varying orientations.
	\item Initiate the calibration.
	\item Evaluate calibration accuracy.
	\item Adjust parameters to improve accuracy (if necessary).
	\item Export parameters as a cameraParameters object.
\end{enumerate}
The accuracy in the calibration routine can be improved by removing outlier images, which contribute more to the reprojection errors than others. Figure \ref{fig:calib_outlier} shows an example of a blurred image, which due to the error introduced to keypoint detection by the blurryness of the image causes a larger reprojection error.
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=.8\linewidth]{outlier_calibration.PNG}
	\caption{Camera Calibration app showing an outlier image.}
	\label{fig:calib_outlier}
\end{figure}
The outliers can be removed by adjusting the threshold for mean pixel reprojection error shown in the upper right corner of figure \ref{fig:calib_outlier}. The calibration app also computes the extrinsic parameters and displays the calibration pattern planes in 3D, as seen in the lower right corner in figure \ref{fig:calib_outlier}.
Having calibrated the camera, the radial distortion in the images can be removed, as seen in figure \ref{fig:distortion}, where a unprocessed image with the calibration pattern key points overlaid can be seen next to the undistorted version.
\begin{figure}[H]

	\end{subfigure}
	\caption{Distorted checkerboard image, along with the undistorted version.}
	\label{fig:distortion}
\end{figure}
The numerical values for the intrinsic matrix was found using this routine as
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{K}=\begin{bmatrix}\alpha & -\alpha\cot{\theta} & x_0\\0 & \frac{\beta}{\sin{\theta}} & y_0\\0 & 0 & 1\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}
1068.7558 & -1.9413 & 893.7339 \\ 0 & 1066.6539 &516.2405\\ 0 & 0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}
