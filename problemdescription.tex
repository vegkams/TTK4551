\section*{\LARGE Problem Description}	
$\\[0.5cm]$

\noindent
The goal of the specialization project is to prepare the processing pipeline leading to camera-lidar fusion. A comparison of detections of interesting objects in the camera data with interesting objects in the lidar data will be performed.\smallskip \\
The following subtasks are proposed for the project:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Installation of Velodyne lidar together with camera, and recording of time-synchronized data from both sensors.
	\item Calibration of the sensors, including specification of world-frame-to-sensor-frame measurement models for both sensors.
	\item Implementation of a detector based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) for the detection of boats in camera data.
	\item Implementation of a detector based on intensity of reflected signal strength for the lidar.
	\item Analysis of the extent to which lidar detections correspond to camera detections and vice versa.
\end{enumerate}
