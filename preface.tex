\noindent This project report presents the work for the mandatory course \textit{TTK4551}, taken during the fall of 2017. While the project has been time consuming and challenging, it has rewarded me with much knowledge, and a deep motivation to pursue the problem further during my Masters thesis.

I would like to thank my supervisors, Edmund F\o rland Brekke and Geir Hamre, for their input, knowledge and support throughout the project. I would also like to thank Bj\o rn-Olav Holtung Eriksen and Andreas Lindahl Fl√•ten, for lending their time and support (and their boat) during the data collection phase of the project. Lastly, I would also like to thank Stefano Bertelli, Gunnar Aske, and all the people at the ITK workshop, for always being helpful in times of need.
