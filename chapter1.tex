\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Motivation}
Autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) operating in urban environments, including ferries, will need slightly different exteroceptive sensors than ASVs operating in the open sea. A lidar with a range of 100 meters may be more appropriate than a maritime radar with range of several kilometers. Furthermore, the complexity of the environment means that the rich information from optical cameras will be more important. In order to build a coherent world image, which, e.g., collision avoidance decisions can be based on, the data from these sensors must be fused, together with data from interoceptive sensor systems such as an inertial navigation system (INS).
\section{Review}
Substantial research has been conducted into the field of remote sensing and data fusion, with a particular drive from the auto industry.
